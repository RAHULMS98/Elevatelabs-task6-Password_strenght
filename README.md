                            Password Strength Evaluation

This repository contains a report on creating and evaluating strong passwords using Password Monster

Tools Used

Password Monster – an online password strength checker that analyzes complexity, length, and predictability.

Summary

Multiple passwords were created with varying complexity levels (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols).

Each password was tested on Password Monster for strength and feedback.

The evaluation highlights best practices: use at least 12–16 characters, mix character types, avoid dictionary words, and ensure randomness.

Understanding password complexity helps defend against brute force, dictionary attacks, and other common password-based threats.

Outcome

This project demonstrates how to create strong, secure passwords and emphasizes the importance of password management for cybersecurity.
